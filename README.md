# Interactive Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard (2015–2018):

## Project Overview:
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data to identify key performance drivers, regional trends, and customer behavior. I transformed raw transactional data into two interactive dashboards designed to support data-driven decision-making for sales managers.

## Technical Skills Used:
**Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, standardized date formats, and removed duplicates using Power Query and Excel functions.
**Data Modeling:** Implemented a relational-style structure within Excel using VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP to connect the Sales_Data to the Product_Master.
**Advanced Formulae:** Utilized Logical, Text, and Lookup functions to categorize sales into "High/Medium/Low" tiers.
**Data Visualization:** Created dynamic Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Timeline filters to allow users to drill down by Region, Category, and Segment.

## Key Insights:
**Revenue Drivers:** The Technology category is the primary revenue driver, contributing ~$827k in total sales.
**Regional Performance:** The West Region is the top contributor, while the South region shows significant room for market penetration.
**Customer Loyalty:** Identified 793 repeat customers, with an average sales value per customer of $2,844.70.
**Seasonality:** Sales show a consistent upward trend year-over-year, with peak performance usually occurring in the final quarter (Q4).

## File Structure:
**Dashboard_1:** Focuses on Sales Trends, Category Performance, and Top Products.
**Dashboard_2:** Focuses on Customer Metrics and Regional distribution.
**Product_Master:** Reference sheet for lookup values.
